For the longest time, I wasn't sure what major I wanted to go into except for the fact that I wanted to study Business. 
As I was indecisive about my major, my boss at work suggested that I try MIS.
After looking up what this major was about, it seemed interesting but also challenging because I'm not really confident in IT.
However, I thought this major might give me a chance in learning something completely new.
